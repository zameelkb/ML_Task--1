# ML_Task--1
Orinson Technologies - Machine Learning Internship : Task-1

Project Overview
This application provides an interactive platform to compare the classification performance of two machine learning models: Decision Tree Classifier and Logistic Regression. It uses the Iris dataset for training and testing, offering users visualizations of classifier accuracies and confusion matrices to better understand the models' performance.

Technologies Used:
Python Flask: Web framework for building the application.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for implementing the classifiers.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: Libraries for creating visualizations.
Pandas & NumPy: Tools for data manipulation and preprocessing.
HTML/CSS: Front-end design for user interaction.

Once the application is running, it will display the following:

Model Accuracy: The percentage accuracy of both classifiers.
Bar Chart Comparison: A side-by-side comparison of model accuracies.
Confusion Matrices: Visual representations of prediction results for both models, showcasing how well each classifier performed.
